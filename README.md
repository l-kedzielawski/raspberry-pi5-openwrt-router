# Pi5 Router: OpenWRT, VLANs, WireGuard, Logging, TCPdumps and Total Network Control

This project demonstrates how to configure a **Raspberry Pi 5** as a secure, high-performance home router using **OpenWRT 24.10.0**. Designed for cybersecurity experimentation and network management, it replaces traditional ISP routers (e.g., NETIA's equipment) with a customizable, cost-effective solution. The setup supports a **1 Gbps ISP connection via PPPoE**, **VLAN segmentation**, **VPNs**, **network-wide ad blocking**, and **advanced logging to a NAS**, making it ideal for a home lab environment.

Skip overpriced routers. Build your own. Learn real skills. Secure your network.

## Usage

### Access the OpenWRT LuCI Interface
- Open a browser and navigate to `http://192.168.2.1`.
- Log in with the credentials you set during OpenWRT setup.

### Monitor Logs on the NAS
- Check centralized logs stored on the NAS:
  ```bash
  ls -lh /mnt/cloud/logs/
  ```
- Logs are organized by device (e.g., `/mnt/cloud/logs/openwrt/`, `/mnt/cloud/logs/AP/`).

### Capture Network Packets
- Start packet capturing on a specific interface (e.g., `eth0.20` for LAN):
  ```bash
  /etc/init.d/tcpdump_logger start eth0.20
  startcp eth0.20
  ```
- Captures are saved to `/mnt/cloud/tcpdumps/` (e.g., `/mnt/cloud/tcpdumps/eth0.20.pcap`).

### Connect via VPN
- Use WireGuard on your phone or laptop to connect to the VPN.
- Access the LuCI interface remotely at `http://192.168.2.1` or SSH into the router:
  ```bash
  ssh root@192.168.2.1
  ```

### Access the Guest Portal
- Connect to the Guest WiFi SSID (VLAN 50).
- Open a browser to access the `opennds` guest portal for authentication (details in [Portal Setup](docs/portal_setup.md)).

## Troubleshooting

- **No Internet**:
  - Verify PPPoE credentials in `/etc/config/network`.
  - Check VLAN configuration on the switch and OpenWRT.
  - Ensure firewall forwarding is enabled (LAN â†’ WAN) in `/etc/config/firewall`.
- **Switch UI Unreachable**:
  - Use the TP-Link Easy Smart Configuration Utility (Windows) to access the TL-SG105E switch.
  - Verify VLAN 20 is correctly configured for switch management.
- **NAS Mount Fails**:
  - Check the NAS mount status:
    ```bash
    df -h | grep /mnt/cloud
    ```
  - Verify CIFS settings and `fstab` configuration ([NAS Setup](docs/nas-setup.md)).
- **MicroSD Card Not Resized**:
  - Follow the resize instructions to use the full capacity of your MicroSD card ([Resize Setup](docs/resize_setup.md)).
- **Any Problems?**:
  - something stuck after power outage first `dd` using backups
